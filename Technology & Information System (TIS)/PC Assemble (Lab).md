## **PC Assemble**

Hi! This is my first lab of TIS. It is about the PC Assemble. In this lab, I gained a practical understanding of how to build the PC and learn some hardware. Now, I can step-by-step to assemble the PC. The step of assemble is:
1. Attach the CPU fan onto the CPU and secure it tightly with screws.  
2. Insert the hard disk into its slot and fasten it firmly with screws.  
3. Insert the RAM module.  
4. Install the power supply unit.  
5. Connect the blue and orange wires.  
6. Put the CPU cover back on.  
7. Check if the CPU is functioning by connecting it to a monitor using an HDMI cable.
