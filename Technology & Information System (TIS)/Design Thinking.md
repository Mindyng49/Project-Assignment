## **Design Thinking: INHAILD & INHALO APP**

In this project, we designed an inhaler called INHALAID. This product is used to help autistic patients calm down.

From this project, our lecture also gave us some suggestions:
1. Make the inhaler look like a toy
2. Use flavors that locals like, such as lemongrass
3. Expand the market, such as collaborating with hospitals
4. Can reduce prices

Our classmates also asked us some questions:
1. What is the difference between our product and e-cigarettes?                                                 
There is no nicotine in our product.

2. How is it different from the recommended flavors?                                                      
The ingredients are hard to find and expensive.

3. Is this product safe for children under 3 years old?                                                   
Use under parental supervision, the ingredients are all natural.

**Reflection:**                                      

 Through this project, I have a goal to contribute meaningful solutions to innovative technologies that improve people's lives. I dream of creating applications that are as efficient as personalized medical tools. This design thinking project has completely improved my overall problem-solving skills. It helped me learn how to define clear problem statements and solve them through ideation, prototyping, and testing. Not only that, this project also emphasized the importance of project collaboration through teamwork. Teamwork taught me how to communicate with each other, share ideas, and develop applications. Looking forward, I plan to expand my technical knowledge, strengthen my user-centered design capabilities, and build a solid portfolio to enhance my industry potential.
