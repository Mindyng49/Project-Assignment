## **VISIT UTM DIGTAL**
On 17 December 2024, we visited UTM DIGITAL. We attended a presentation at the Dewan Seminar. The presentation covered UTM Digitalâ€™s services, digital infrastructure, information systems, and system development. After that, we toured the lobby, smart meeting rooms, open offices, and digital care multifunctional area. Then, we  interviewed Encik Nazrul and Encik Wan Mat to learn more about UTM Digital this company. After the visit, I had a better understanding of the work environment and career in computer science.
