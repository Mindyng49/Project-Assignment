**Reflection :**
During the Petronas Industry Talk, I learned about how to work in the technology industry and what skills we must develop to be successful. The key learning points were the importance of developing diverse skills and collaboration. Not only that, but pursuing real-world experience to succeed in the technology industry. Apart from that, technical and soft skills can be learned. Lastly, interpersonal skills. The importance of developing diverse skills, collaboration and pursuing real-world experience in my chosen field.
