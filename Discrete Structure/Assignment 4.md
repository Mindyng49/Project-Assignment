**Reflection :**
This assignment let me learn about  trees and finite automata helped me understand how data is structured and how machines process information. Trees are useful for organizing data. Finite automata showed me how simple models can recognize patterns, which is important in programming and language processing. Finite State Machines (FSM) was a bit challenging, but more  practice would make them easier. This assignment improved my problem-solving skills and gave me a better understanding of computer science concepts.
