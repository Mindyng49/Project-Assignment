**Reflection :**
This assignment let me learn about  set theory and functions. It helped me organize and relate data clearly. Set theory is useful in programming, while functions like one-to-one are important in coding. The concepts of proving properties were challenging. Overall, this assignment  improved my problem-solving and logical thinking skills for discrete structure.
