**Reflection :**
This assignment let me learn about  recurrence relations, counting methods, permutations and combinations, and the pigeonhole principle helped me solve problems in a better way. Recurrence relations taught me how to break problems into smaller steps. Counting methods and permutations helped me understand how to arrange and choose things. The pigeonhole principle showed that some outcomes are unavoidable. The difficult recurrence problems were hard to understand but assignment would help me more understand.
