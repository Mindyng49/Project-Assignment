**Reflection :**
This assignment let me learn about  discrete probability theory and graph theory helped me understand how to analyze chances and connections. Discrete probability taught me how to calculate the the probability of an event occurring. Graph theory helped me see how things are connected like networks and paths. The complex probability calculations was a bit tricky but more  practice would make them easier.
