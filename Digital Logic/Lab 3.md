**Reflection :**
In the digital logic lab, I learned how flip-flops and synchronous counters work. I and my group member connected wires to the IC carefully to make sure everything worked correctly. At first, understanding how the clock signal controls the counter was tricky, but doing the experiment made it clearer. It would be helpful to have more examples to see how these circuits are used in real life. Overall, this lab helped me understand digital circuits better.
