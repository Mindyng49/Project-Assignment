## ** Network Packet Transmission Monitoring System**

In this project, user is required to choose a single digit number of packet data that user wanted to transfer from computers of lab A to computers of lab B. User can control manually the packet data transfer from one of the six computers from lab A to one of the six computers from lab B. Transfer of packet data will stop when the number of packet data transferred reached the number user chosen.
This is the circuits that my group member and I design

**Reflection :**
This project let me have the chance to put theoretical learning to practice in a real-life project and help me more understanding the digital logic theory with components such as Flip-Flops, multiplexers, and counters. Furthermore, it not only allowed me to develop technical skills but also to work with a team. While this circuit is simpler than a real-world system, it also inspired me to explore advanced topics like error detection and also inspired me to further my study of digital circuit design.
