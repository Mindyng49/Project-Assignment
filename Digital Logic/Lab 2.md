**Reflection :**
Using the Deeds simulator to design combinational circuits helped me understand how logic gates work together to produce specific outputs. I learned how to create circuits using AND, OR, NOT, and other logic gates to perform different functions. Overall, this experience improved my skills in digital logic and circuit design.
