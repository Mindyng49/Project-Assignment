**Reflection :**
In the digital logic lab, I learned how to properly connect wires to Integrated Circuits (ICs) to build and test circuits. This hands-on experience helped me understand how logic gates work in real applications. At first, it was challenging to ensure correct connections but discuss with my group member like we use a clear wiring plan and double-checking connections made the process easier. Overall, this lab let me more understand about the basic gates of digital circuits.
